# Vapor Decision
This is a React implementation of the angular app vapor-decision that was started a few months ago. 

To see the older version of this application built in angular please follow this [link](https://github.com/zagapyan/vapor-decision-beta 'vapor decision using angular')

Instead of working with Angular and Google Maps, this has been reworked in Angular.
This instance uses:
* firebase
* react
* webpack

To run, install the repo and run `npm start`
